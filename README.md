# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
It is crucial for the software to meet business needs, it maintains stakeholder confidence nad also maintains the balance with cost. Project managers can ensure deadlines are met using project management tools like Jira, setting clear milestones and also preparing risk management tools early. 
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Const maintains profitability and prevents financial strain. Strategies to prevent bdget overrun:
Define realistic budget and contingency fund
Implement scope control and avoid feature creep
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile:
Advantages: Flexibility, iterative, promotes continuous feedback.
Disadvantages: Requires frequent communication, can lead to scope creep, harder to document.
Waterfall:
Advantages: Clear structure, well-documented, easy to track progress.
Disadvantages: Less adaptable to change, longer development cycles, late-stage defect detection.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile if better for dynamic projects with evolving requirements eg mobile apps
Waterfall is better for projects with well-defined requirements eg banking software
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Use of automated testing.
User acceptance testing.
Code reviews and peer programming.
High standards promote user satisfaction.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining scope prevents scope creep, sets clear expectations, and improves resource planning.
A WBS breaks down projects into smaller tasks, making project tracking and resource allocation easier.
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
A detailed schedule improves time management and accountability.
Gantt charts visually track task dependencies, deadlines, and progress.
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
Delays in predictability of disease. The disease are harmful and can cause death
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
It aligns the development team with user needs, prevents unnecessary features, and ensures efficient problem-solving. It gives a better understanding of the matter at hand.
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
Provide pictures with a bit of description about its relevance and its goal.
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
Unique features such as ML-driven predictions.
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
Research industry reports, competitor analysis, and user demand studies to estimate market size.
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
Trends help identify emerging technologies, user preferences, and competitive advantages
